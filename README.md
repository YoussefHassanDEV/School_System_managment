1. Project Overview
The Student Management System is a Spring Boot REST API that manages:

Users (SUPER_MANAGER, MANAGER, TEACHER, STUDENT)

Managers, Teachers, Students

Subjects

Exams

Student enrollment and promotion

It uses JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization with role hierarchy:

nginx
Copy
Edit
SUPER_MANAGER > MANAGER > TEACHER > STUDENT
Meaning higher roles inherit permissions from lower ones.

2. Features & Technologies
Features:

User registration & login with JWT authentication

Role-based access control with hierarchy

CRUD operations for Managers, Teachers, Students

Student subject enrollment and promotion

Exam creation and result tracking

Password encryption using BCrypt

Protection of endpoints based on user role

Tech stack:

Java 17+

Spring Boot 3.x

Spring Security 6+

JWT (io.jsonwebtoken)

Spring Data JPA + Hibernate

H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL (configurable)

Lombok

Maven

3. Authentication & Role Hierarchy
Roles:

SUPER_MANAGER: Can manage managers, teachers, students, exams

MANAGER: Can manage teachers, students, exams

TEACHER: Can manage students, exams

STUDENT: Can view GPA, level, take exams

Hierarchy:

text
Copy
Edit
ROLE_SUPER_MANAGER > ROLE_MANAGER
ROLE_MANAGER > ROLE_TEACHER
ROLE_TEACHER > ROLE_STUDENT
JWT authentication flow:

Sign up (/api/auth/signup)

Login (/api/auth/login) â†’ Receive JWT

Send JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token> header for protected endpoints

4. Installation & Setup

6. Usage Flow
SUPER_MANAGER creates managers.

Managers create teachers.

Teachers create students.

Students enroll in subjects and take exams.

Passing all subjects in a level promotes a student.

7. Important Notes
Always send JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

Passwords are stored encrypted (BCrypt).

SUPER_MANAGER can do everything MANAGER, TEACHER, and STUDENT can.

You can change DB from H2 to MySQL/PostgreSQL in application.properties.

Role hierarchy is defined in SecurityConfig and applied to all endpoints.
